  <h1>Petra</h1>
  <p>Inhabited since prehistorie times, this Nabataean caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea, was
    an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half carved into the rock,
    and
    by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where
    ancient Eastern traditions blend with Hellenistie architecture.</p>
